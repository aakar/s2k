WIP - simple CLI tool for day-to-day sycronization of kindle books between local directory and supported device using wire protocol - MTP or old USB mount.

So far Windows x64 functionality seems to be complete enough for me to use it in my real life. I will look into Linux support next.

Configuration is described [here](https://github.com/rupor-github/sync2kindle/blob/main/config/config.yaml.tmpl)

Syncronization logic is defined [here](https://github.com/rupor-github/sync2kindle/blob/main/sync/prepare.go)
